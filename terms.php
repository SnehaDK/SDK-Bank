                            Larger banks may have multiple routing numbers that are based on the geographic 
                            location where the account was opened.</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">2. FDIC</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. A government-run organization that insures customersâ€™ 
                                bank deposits up to $250,000 if the bank fails. The National Credit Union Administration is
                                the equivalent for credit unions. (Read more about how FDIC insurance works.)</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Commonly known as a CD, an account into which you deposit a sum of money and agree to keep it there 
                                        for a specified length of time. The account typically pays higher interest rates than standard savings 
                                        and checking accounts.</p>

                                <h5 class="card-title">4. APY</h5>

                                        including compound interest. (Want additional details? Read more about why securing a high APY is 
                                        important for your savings.)</p>

                                <h5 class="card-title">5. APR</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Annual percentage rate. The amount of interest you gain from keeping money in an account in a year, 
                                not including compound interest. In the context of a loan, the APR represents the cost of borrowing money.</p>

                                <h5 class="card-title">6. Savings account</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Typically, an interest-bearing account used to hold money for short- or long-term goals or emergencies.
                                        You can add to this account at any time, but certain types of withdrawals may be limited to six per month.</p>

                                <h5 class="card-title">7. Checking account</h5>
